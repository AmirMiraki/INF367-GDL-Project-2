# Group symmetry on convolutional neural network
------------------------------------------------
As a first step, we state that the symmetry group includes translation and rotation.

Next, apply a group smoothing approach to make equvarient convolutional layers.

Then implement a network where the first two layers are equivalent on the C4 group.

Lastly, compare the results of the networks on the right image and the input that has been rotated 90 degrees.
